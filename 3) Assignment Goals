# Choose Your Own Adventure

Your task is to create a "Choose Your Own Adventure" text-based game. Your game will present to the user a plot-line and an initial
decision to make. The user will enter data to indicate their choice, and then the story should continue to present the user
with plot twists, new characters and decisions. All choices should lead to final outcomes: some successful, others not.
You decide the context, theme or plot of your story. Some suggestions include:  <br>
- The user is a pirate trying to discover a buried treasure.
- The user is a movie star living in L.A.
- The user is in a haunted house and must get out.
- The user has lost his or her phone and is trying to find it.
- The user is a country leader trying to make the best decisions for the people.
- The user is making life choices after winning the lottery.
- The user is a sales clerk trying to sell to customers.
- The user is a plane crash survivor trying to stay alive.
- The user is a crime fighter trying to solve a mystery.  
<br>
Start by planning the possible stroylines in advance. It is recommended that you plan your game using a flowchart. However, your flowchart will not be graded. Your game will involve several nested if-elif-else statements and it will be much easier to write
once you have already developed the program plot, decisions and logic.<br>  
<br>  
Save your game as a .py file in this repo. See rubric for assessment details.
