# Encryption

We looked at some examples of encryption in module 7. Now it's your turn to make your own unique encryption program. To do this, you will:

-  Create an 'encrypt' function that takes a user's plaintext message as its only argument and uses at least 3 Python string methods to encrypt the message and return the ciphertext to the user.
-  Your encryption method should be unique and original.
-  Create a second 'decrypt' function that takes the ciphertext as its only argument and returns the original plaintext message. <br><br>


**Optional Extension (not required to achieve full marks)**: Was this easy for you? If so, strengthen your encryption by adding a second argument to each function, the encryptionKey.
