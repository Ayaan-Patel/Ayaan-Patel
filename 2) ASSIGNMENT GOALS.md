# Encryption

We looked at some examples of encryption in module 7. Now it's your turn to make your own unique encryption program. To do this, you will:

-  Create an 'encrypt' function that takes a user's plaintext message, encrypts the message and returns the ciphertext to the user.
-  Your encryption method should be unique and original.
-  Create a second 'decrypt' function that takes the ciphertext and returns the original plaintext message.
-  Strengthen your encryption by adding a second argument to each function, the encryptionKey.
